#### Problem Statement

Today, the lack of trees in urban environments contributes to several environmental problems that we must begin to act on, such as air pollution, the urban heat island effect, and reduced biodiversity. Identifying areas with a high need for trees or green infrastructure is crucial to effectively mitigate these issues and improve the quality of life for residents.

#### Solution

The proposed solution is an application that operates with machine learning to analyze several factors such as air pollution levels, temperature variations, population density, and socio-economic indicators to identify areas within urban environments that are most in need of trees and green infrastructure so that urban planners and environmental organizations can get insights to plan and implement reforestation campaigns strategically.â€‹
In addition, the application will act as a network to connect volunteers and organizations, so that the help and environmental Impact of these campaigns can be multiplied.

#### Vision

Empower individuals, communities, and organizations to collaborate effectively in combating deforestation and climate change.
